                                '''File Handling'''

1. File Handling is the important part of web applications
2. Python has the several functions like creating,reading,updating and deleting files

3. The file handling here using open() keyword used
4. The syntax of the file handling is '''open(filename,mode)'''
5. The open function makes the 2 parametres
        1. filename  2. mode
6. There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:
7. After end time we close the file


"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists


x = open('filename.txt','w')
print(x.write('Hello Here Iam Creating FileHandling'))          #file is create using write operation
print(x.writelines())
print(x.writable())
x.close()

x = open('filename.txt','r')
print(x.read())                                                 # read the data in files
print(x.readable())
print(x.readline())
x.close()


x = open('filename.txt','a')
print(x.write('this is appending operation'))                    #Already existing data and new data add using apending operation
x.close()

1. with open('file.txt','r') as p:
    print(p.read())
    p.close()

1.1 with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
        data = file.readlines()
        for line in data:
            word = line.split()
            print (word)
            file.close()

2. with open('file.txt','r') as p:
    print(p.readlines())
    p.close()

3. with open('file.txt','r') as p:
    print(p.readable())
    p.close()

4. with open('file.txt','w') as p:
    print(p.write('Hello welcome Python language'))
    print(p.writelines('python is interpreter language'))
    p.close()

5. with open('file.txt','a') as p:
    print(p.write('Hello welcome Python language'))
    p.close()


7. How to remove the file
import os
os.remove('file.txt')
